# Mobile App Development Project 2025 - AGH University of Krakow

This project aims to create an app that manages multiple character sheets for DnD. 
Each character sheet contains all the important information about the character, like stats, 
race, class, attacks, spells etc. Armor class, hp and spell slots are calculated automatically based on
the rest of the stats.
